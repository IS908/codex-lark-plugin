/**
 * In-memory mapping from (chat_id, thread_id?) to the Feishu open_id of the
 * current caller. Populated by channel.ts on inbound messages and by
 * scheduler.ts when a cronjob fires. Consumed by sensitive MCP tools so they
 * never need to trust Codex-declared identity arguments.
 *
 * Intentionally not persisted — the next inbound message or cronjob tick will
 * re-populate relevant entries, so crash/restart is safe.
 *
 * Terminal invocations (e.g. $lark:jobs) pass the reserved chat_id
 * `__terminal__` which resolves through the owner fallback.
 *
 * SECURITY NOTE: the __terminal__ sentinel is a trust-but-verify fallback.
 * A socially-engineered prompt could theoretically instruct Codex to pass
 * __terminal__ from a Feishu-triggered turn, escalating to operator
 * privileges. Defense in depth:
 *   1. MCP server instructions (index.ts) tell Codex to use the chat_id
 *      from notification metadata verbatim and never substitute sentinels.
 *   2. Phase 3 adds audit logging so any such attempt leaves a trail.
 *   3. Future work may add server-side heuristic (reject __terminal__ when
 *      there is a fresh real-chat session entry within the last N seconds).
 * The sentinel is not exposed in any notification metadata, so Codex would
 * need to invent the string on its own — practical risk is low.

/**
 * Sentinel caller for buffer auto-flush turns (#66). The flush is a
 * system-initiated, chat-level distillation — no user triggered it. We
 * bind this synthetic caller before the flush notification so the
 * server-side `resolveCaller` gate passes and `save_memory(type=chat|thread)`
 * can persist.
 *
 * NOT a valid profile owner — `save_memory(type=profile)` rejects this
 * sentinel server-side (system has no user identity to attribute private
 * data to). The flush prompt also instructs Codex not to attempt profile
 * writes during flush turns; this constant is the second line of defense.
 *
 * `resolveCaller` in tools.ts further restricts the sentinel to only
 * `save_memory` — any other sensitive tool (`create_job`, `forget_memory`,
 * etc.) is denied to prevent sentinel-attributed records that no real
 * user could later address.
 *
 * Audit log entries for system-flush writes carry caller=`__system_flush__`,
 * making the data lineage greppable.
 *
 * Operator constraint: `LARK_OWNER_OPEN_ID` MUST NOT equal this value.
 * If it did, terminal invocations would resolve through `ownerFallback()`
 * to the sentinel and inherit the sentinel's restrictive guard — the
 * operator would be locked out of every sensitive tool except save_memory.
 * Realistic risk near zero (Feishu open_ids are `ou_*`), but documented
 * for completeness.
