This is a buffer flush triggered by inactivity, not a user message. The plugin has bound a system caller for this turn, so save_memory(type="chat", ...) will succeed even though no real user invoked it.

The following is a conversation from chat ${chatId} (${messageCount} messages).
Please:
1. Write a 3-5 sentence summary focusing on: what was discussed, what was decided, what was resolved, and any open items.
2. Call save_memory(type="chat", content=<summary>, reason=<why>, chat_id="${chatId}") to persist it. Do not output a reply — this is system, not user.

Do NOT call save_memory(type="profile", ...) in this turn — profile writes are user-scoped (they persist into a specific user's profile directory), and a system caller has no user identity to attribute private-tier data to. The server-side gate will reject any profile write attempt here. Individual profile updates are handled by a separate distillation stage.

  "public":  [ "fact", "fact", ... ],   // facts safe for anyone who @mentions this user to see
  "private": [ "fact", "fact", ... ]    // facts only the user themselves should see
}

Classification rules (apply in order; higher priority wins):
1. Match any "Always private" rule in L2 → private.
2. Match any "Always public" rule in L2 → public.
3. Specific emails, phone numbers, monetary amounts, passwords, tokens, credentials — ALWAYS private, even if mentioned in a group.
4. Source-based default:
   - chatType=group → unknown facts default to public (they were already said in front of the group).
   - chatType=p2p → unknown facts default to private (never voluntarily shared beyond 1:1).
5. When truly uncertain: choose private.

Return ONLY the JSON object, no prose or code fences. Then call save_memory(type="profile", content=<public-array-as-markdown-list>, reason=<why>, chat_id=<current>, tier="public", mode="replace") and again with tier="private" for the private array. Skip either call if its array is empty. mode="replace" is required — this flush rewrites the full tier from a fresh read of history, so the existing file should be overwritten rather than appended to.`;
